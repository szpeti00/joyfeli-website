              I moved to Wageningen to study Ecology and immediately fell in love with the city and its stunning natural surroundings. It was here that I discovered a deep connection between people and nature: just like ecosystems, we rely on an interplay of internal and external factors. Our well-being is shaped by <strong>biological, psychological, and social layers</strong>, constantly interacting with each other.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the years went on, my focus shifted from my academic study to an increasing passion for sport, lifestyle, and movement. What began with outdoor adventures like climbing, white-water kayaking, and bouldering expanded into indoor activities such as spinning, pilates, xcore, and fitness. My interest in nature, movement, and people led me to explore how we <strong>think, communicate, and behave</strong>, with a special focus on health and well-being. This inspired me to start coaching and guiding people both physically and mentally.

              Nature and human connection are at the core of everything I do. In the <strong>summer</strong>, I pass on my love for the outdoors as a white-water kayaking instructor in the mountains of Slovenia. In the <strong>winter</strong>, I coach individuals in the gym and teach group classes, sharing my passion for movement and vitality.
            </p>
            <p>
              With over <strong>eight years of experience</strong> as a <strong>certified instructor</strong>, I’ve gained valuable insights into how people think, feel, and act. This strengthened my belief: with positive energy, we make the world stronger, happier, and more beautiful. To radiate that energy, it’s essential to be healthy, strong, and resilient. My mission is to inspire myself and others to embrace their strength and live life with vitality

          My journey began with a university degree in science, where my interest in communication and human psychology first became apparent. I then developed my skills in coaching and training, both in extreme natural environments and in the gym. Over time, my focus expanded to include human behavior and its impact on lifestyle.
